## Introduction

This repository owns a binary search tree algorithm implemented as an IP for FPGA and ASIC. It is
designed with SystemVerilog.

- the [functional specification](doc/functional_spec.md)
- the [info document](doc/info.md) provides basic information about this type of algorithm
- the [interface document](doc/interface.md) provides information about the interface of the IP
and how to use it
